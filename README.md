# customer-plugin
The files in this folder were used to code a unit conversion WordPress Plugin in addition with other files. I bought the plugin, then customized it. You can see the finished product at https://www.itechtools.ca, called 'Torque Calculator'. The rest of the files were untouched.

This repository contains 2 folders:
1. Original Plugin:
This contains the original code of the plugin I bought from WordPress

2. Edited Plugin:
This contains the files I edited from the original code to meet our client's needs. These were the only 2 files from the plugin I changed.
