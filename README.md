# customer-plugin

This repository contains 2 folders:
1. The original code of the plugin I bought from WordPress
2. The files I edited from the original code to meet our client's needs. These were the only 2 files from the plugin I changed.

The purpose of the plugin was to perform unit conversion. You can see the finished product at https://www.itechtools.ca.
